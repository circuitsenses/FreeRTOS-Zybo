A future release of the ZYBO Base System design
will include a datasheet for the axi_dispctrl core 
in this location, including a list of Parameters,
Ports, and software accessible registers. Check back
very soon for an updated project. 

For the time being, refer to the included hardware 
designs (XPS and Vivado projects) and SDK software to 
learn how to use this core.
