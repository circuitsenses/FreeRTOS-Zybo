A future release of the ZYBO Base System design
will include a datasheet for the hdmi_tx core 
in this location, including a list of Parameters
and Ports. Check back very soon for an updated project. 

For the time being, refer to the included hardware 
designs (XPS and Vivado projects) and SDK software
to learn how to use this core.
